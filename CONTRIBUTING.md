# Contributing guidelines


## Submitting bugreports


Though any kind of feedback, feature request and bugreport is appreciated, I would more prefer if you would send a proper
pull request with a failing test in case you find a bug in the library.

Currently there is a simple mechanism in the integration loading to make it easy to add new loading. Using this is especially
preferred if your bugreport is related to a complex schema or multiple schemas. There is no need to dig into the java code,
you only have to create a few new files in the repo (but you will have to run the loading - see the build instructions below).

### Steps:
 * create an issue, just to get an issue number
 * fork the repository
 * in your fork, create a directory under the `jsonschema-loading/src/test/resources/io/sbsp/jsonschema/issues/` directory (for example `issue42` )
 * in this directory create a `schema.json` file with your JSON Schema document that is not handled correctly
 * in the same directory create a `subject-valid.json` file, which is a JSON document, and you expect that document to pass
the validation, but due to a bug it fails with a `ValidationException`
 * if you have a JSON document that you expect to be invalid, but it passes the validation, then you should name this file `subject-invalid.json`.
It will mean that for the test suite that an expected `ValidationException` is not thrown.
 * you can create both the `subject-valid.json` and `subject-invalid.json` test files if you find it needed


### Remote schema loading:
If your testcase has anything to do with remote schemas, then
 * you can put those schemas under the `yourIssueDir/remotes/` directory
 * the `yourIssueDir/remotes/` directory will act as the document root of a HTTP server during test execution
 * this HTTP server will listen at address `http://localhost:1234` so please change your schemas (`id` and `$ref` properties)
to fetch the remote schemas relative from this address

You can find a good example for all of these in the `jsonschema-loading/src/test/resources/io/sbsp/jsonschema/issues/issue17` testcase.

If you successfully created your testcase, then it will fail with an `AssertionError` with a message like
"validation failed with: io.sbsp.jsonschema.validation.ValidationError:..." or "did not throw ValidationError for invalid subject",
and then you are ready to send a pull request.

### Defining expected failures in integration loading

In some cases the error you want to report is not about "if a given json is valid against a schema", but instead an inproper validation failure report to be tested. In such case you can create a testcase which contains:
* a `schema.json`
* a `subject-invalid.json`
* an `expectedException.json`

The last one should contain a JSON description of the expected exception. Such an exception description has at most 2 keys:
* `message`: (required) the value is the expected exception message
* `causingExceptions` : (optional) the value is an array of causing exceptions (which are returned by the `Ä¡etCausingExceptions()` method of the expected `ValidationException`). Each item of this entry should also be an exception description, so these are objects with a required `message` and an optional `causingExceptions` key. Example `expectedException.json`:

```js
{
  "message": "#: 4 schema violations found",
  "causingExceptions": [
     {
        "message": "#/0: 2 schema violations found",
        "causingExceptions": [
           {
              "message": "#/0/name: expected type: String, found: JSONArray"
           },
           {
              "message": "#/0/dimensions/width: expected type: Number, found: String"
           }
        ]
     },
     {
        "message": "#/1: required key [price] not found"
     },
     {
        "message": "#/2/id: expected type: Number, found: String"
     }
  ]
}
```

## Building the project locally

Prerequisities: the following tools have to be installed:
* jdk1.8.0_45 (earlier versions of javac cannot compile the project due to a type inference issue)
* maven 3.input


Steps for building the project:
* clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/smartytime/json-schema.git && cd json-schema/`
* build it with maven: `mvn clean install`

(or just `mvn clean test` if you are only interested in running the loading)
